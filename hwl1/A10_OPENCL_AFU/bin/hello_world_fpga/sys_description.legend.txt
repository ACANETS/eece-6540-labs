- Version Identifier
- Random hash
- Board name
- Specifies whether the kernel was built in big-endian mode
- Specifies number of global memory systems
For each global memory
  - Memory name
  - Memory type
  - Number of memory interfaces (DIMMS or banks) usable as device global memory
  - Memory configuration address
  - Specifies whether the memory access is burst-interleaved across memory interfaces
  For each memory interface (DIMM or bank)
    - Global memory interace start address
    - Global memory interface end address
- Number of kernels
  For each kernel:
   - Kernel name
   - Start address of kernel control registers
   - Size of kernel control registers
   - Depth of kernel fast relaunch buffer
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0x0 (for internal use)
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-group invariant. If the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to make local_size = global_size. This is an optimization.
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel is work-item invariant. If the value is 1, kernel launch will be modified to ensure that only a single thread is present on the device at a time.  This enables a variety of compiler optimizations.
   - Number of times kernel operations are vectorized. The kernel will launched with fewer work-items in each work-groups as many times as the number of vector lanes.
   - number of words in this kernel's profile scan chain.
   - Number of kernel arguments
   For each kernel argument:
    - internal # representing its type
    - internal # representing its category
    - its size
   - Number of printf calls
   For each printf call:
    - internal # representing its index
    - internal # representing its format string
   - Number of local memory systems.
   - X-dim of required work-group size (controlled by __attribute__((reqd_work_group_size(X, Y, Z))) )
   - Y-dim of required work-group size
   - Z-dim of required work-group size
   - Number of Maximum work-group size arguments to follow (1, 2 or 3)
   - Scalarized Version of Maximum work-group size
   - Maximum global work dimension (controlled by __attribute__((max_global_work_dim(N))))
   - 0/1 value to indicate if the kernel supports a non-zero global_work_offset argument to clEnqueueNDRangeKernel (controlled by __attribute__((uses_global_work_offset(N))))
- ROM size
